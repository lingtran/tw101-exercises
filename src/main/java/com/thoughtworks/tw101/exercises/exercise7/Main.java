// Write a program that chooses a random number between 1 and 100. Then asks the user to enter a guess. If they guess
// right then tell them they win, otherwise tell them if they guessed too high or low. Keep asking the user to guess
// until they get the right answer. Use classes to separate the different concerns of this program.

        // capture number that user guessed
        // check if number is too high or too low

        // repeat steps between user entering a guess and checking if number is high/low
